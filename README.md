# FashionBlog

This codebase was created to demonstrate a backend application built with SpringBoot framework including RESTful services, CRUD operations, authentication, pagination, and more.

I've gone to great lengths to adhere to the SpringBoot framework community style guides & best practices.

# How it works

The API is built with SPring Boot, making use of Swagger for documentation, mysql as the database.

The application is using a custom JWT auth implementation.

# Usage

The API is available at http://localhost:8080/api/v1

Swagger UI will be live at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.
